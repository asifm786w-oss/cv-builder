_Last updated: 4 December 2025_

**Munibs Career Support Tools** is committed to making our CV and cover letter builder accessible and usable for as many people as possible, including users with disabilities and different access needs.

## 1. Our commitment

We aim to:

- Design pages with clear structure and headings  
- Use legible fonts and sufficient contrast where possible  
- Keep layout simple and predictable  
- Support use on modern desktop and mobile browsers  
- Make content understandable and navigable, including with keyboard controls  

This is an ongoing process and we are continually working to improve.

---

## 2. Current status

The Service is built using web technologies (including Streamlit) and is primarily:

- Navigable via standard web browsers  
- Usable with keyboard navigation for main actions  
- Designed with relatively simple layout and clear sections  

However, we recognise that the Service may **not yet fully meet** all requirements of WCAG 2.1 AA or equivalent accessibility standards.

Areas that may present challenges include:

- Some colour contrasts may not be optimal in all templates  
- Certain UI components are provided by underlying frameworks and may have limitations  
- Dynamic content updates may not always be announced by assistive technologies  

We are working to identify and improve these areas over time.

## 3. Tips for improving your experience

You may find the Service easier to use if you:

- Zoom the page (e.g. Ctrl + + / Cmd + +) to increase text size  
- Use your browser’s reader mode (where available)  
- Use high-contrast mode in your operating system or browser  
- Adjust font and colour settings in your device accessibility options  

---

## 4. Future improvements

We plan to explore:

- Improved contrast and font options  
- A “simple mode” with more minimal layout  
- Better support and labelling for assistive technologies  
- Additional keyboard shortcuts for common actions  

Accessibility is an ongoing journey and we welcome feedback.
