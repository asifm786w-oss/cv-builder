## 1. Our commitment

We aim to:

- Provide clear page structure and consistent headings  
- Use readable fonts and reasonable colour contrast where possible  
- Keep layouts simple, predictable, and easy to follow  
- Support use on modern desktop and mobile browsers  
- Ensure content is understandable and usable with keyboard navigation  

Accessibility is an ongoing consideration and improvements are made where feasible.

## 2. Current accessibility status

The Service is built using modern web technologies (including Streamlit) and is generally:

- Accessible through standard web browsers  
- Usable with keyboard navigation for primary actions  
- Structured with clear sections and logical flow  

However, the Service may **not fully conform** to WCAG 2.1 AA or equivalent accessibility standards at this time.

Known limitations may include:

- Colour contrast variations across templates  
- UI components provided by third-party frameworks  
- Dynamic updates that may not always be announced to assistive technologies  

We continue to review and improve these areas.

## 3. Improving your experience

You may find the Service easier to use by:

- Adjusting browser zoom levels to increase text size  
- Using reader or simplified viewing modes where available  
- Enabling high-contrast or accessibility settings on your device  
- Customising font and display preferences in your operating system

## 4. Planned improvements

Where possible, we intend to explore:

- Enhanced contrast and font configuration options  
- A simplified interface mode  
- Improved labelling for assistive technologies  
- Additional keyboard navigation enhancements  

Feedback helps guide future improvements.
