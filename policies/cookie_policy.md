## 1. What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website or use a web application. They are widely used to make websites work, improve user experience, and provide information to service providers.

Similar technologies may include local storage, pixels, and scripts.

## 2. How we use cookies

**Mulyba Digital Tools** may use cookies and similar technologies to:

- Remember your preferences or choices (for example, selected templates)  
- Enable the Service to function correctly  
- Understand how the Service is used (basic analytics)  
- Improve performance, stability, and reliability  

We currently do **not** use cookies for targeted advertising.

Because the Service is built using technologies such as Streamlit and may rely on third-party services, some cookies may be set automatically to provide core functionality.

These cookies help us understand how users interact with the Service so we can improve it.  
They may collect information such as:

## 5. Third-party services

Some features of the Service may rely on third-party providers (such as hosting, analytics, or AI services). These providers may set their own cookies in accordance with their own privacy and cookie policies.

Where possible, we aim to minimise the use of non-essential third-party cookies and focus only on what is required to provide and improve the Service.
