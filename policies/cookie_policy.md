This Cookie Policy explains how **Munibs Career Support Tools** (“we”, “us”, “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies when you use our CV and cover letter builder (the “Service”).

## 1. What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website or use a web application. They are widely used to make websites work, improve user experience and provide information to website owners.

Similar technologies include local storage, pixels and scripts.

---

## 2. How we use cookies

Munibs Career Support Tools may use cookies and similar technologies to:

- Remember your preferences or choices (e.g. selected template)
- Help the Service function correctly
- Understand how the Service is used (basic analytics)
- Improve performance and reliability

We currently do **not** use cookies for targeted advertising.

Because the Service is built using technologies like Streamlit and potentially third-party services, some cookies may be set by those services to deliver basic functionality.

## 3. Types of cookies we may use

### a) Strictly necessary cookies

These are essential for the Service to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.  
They are usually set in response to actions you take, such as navigating pages or using features.

### b) Performance and analytics cookies

These help us understand how users interact with the Service, so we can improve it.  
For example, they might track:

- Which pages are visited
- Error states or performance issues
- Rough usage volumes

We aim to use these in a privacy-conscious way, and where possible, in aggregate form.

## 4. Managing cookies

You can control cookies in several ways:

- Adjust your browser settings to block or delete cookies
- Use browser add-ons or tools to manage tracking and storage
- Decline non-essential cookies where a banner or preference centre is made available

Please note:

- Blocking some cookies may affect how the Service works
- Certain features may not function properly if cookies are disabled

You can usually find cookie settings in your browser under:

- **Settings → Privacy & Security**
- **Internet Options → Privacy**
- Or equivalent sections.

## 5. Third-party services

Some functionality may rely on third parties (for example, hosting providers, analytics tools or AI providers). These providers may set and use their own cookies in accordance with their privacy and cookie policies.

Where possible, we aim to minimise the use of intrusive third-party cookies and focus on what is necessary to provide and improve the Service.

## 6. Changes to this Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time.

When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top.  
We encourage you to review this Policy periodically.
